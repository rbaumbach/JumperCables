This directory can be used to store other directories that can be referenced from
the Jumper Cables script.

1) Add .ssh directory with public/private ssh keys, configs, etc. here.  If this directory
   exists, it will be copied over when the ssh.sh script is run instead of generating a
   new default SSH key.

   ex: .ssh/id_rsa.pub, .ssh/id_rsa, .ssh/config

2) Add .gnupg directory with all your gpg files (keyrings, etc.) here.  If this directory
   exists, it will be copied over when the gpg.sh script is run instead of generating a
   new default gpg key.

   ex: .gnupg/pubring.kbx, .gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
