This directory is used to store other directories that can be referenced from
the Jumper Cables script.

1) Add .ssh directory with public/private ssh keys, configs, etc. here.  If this directory
   exists, it will be copied over when the ssh.sh script is run instead of generating a
   new default SSH key.

   ex: .ssh/id_rsa.pub, .ssh/id_rsa, .ssh/config
